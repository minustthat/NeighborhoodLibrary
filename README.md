NeighborhoodLibrary is a console based application used to simulate a real life library. I've added features to check out books, check in books, display all books, display books that aren't checked in, and leave. 

Here is a glimpse of the methods that make these actions possible: ![](/Users/nolimit/Desktop/GitProjYU/NeighborhoodLibrary/Images /Screenshot 2024-04-22 at 16.30.17.png)

The welcome screen will reappear after each action to make sure you stay until you've done all that you wish, and pressing the (4) choice will allow you to close the program, which simulates you leaving the library.

Checking in a book will require a name and title, and will notify you that the book is now checked out. 

Checking in a book will return it to the library for someone else to use.
